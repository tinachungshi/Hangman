# Adventure Time Hangman

## Description
It's your favorite Hangman game, but with a twist-- an Adventure Time themed murder mystery! You're entering into the world of Finn and Jake (hint, hint) and your main priority is to save the Earl of Lemongrab from danger! Do you have what it takes to become the best adventurer of all?

If you're not an Adventure Time fanatic you'll be one soon. Go through all the alphabets and watch as Lemongrab materializes in front of your eyes. Guess the correct word and save him before it's too late! You only have 6 chances, so time's ticking-- but if you want to watch him die, no judgements made here.
